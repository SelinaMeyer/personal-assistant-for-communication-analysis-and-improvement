I just finished reviewing the project proposal that Amy prepared. While I appreciate the effort she put into it, I have noticed several issues that I believe we need to address as a team.\\n\\nFirstly, the objective of the project was not clearly defined. I assumed that we all agreed on the fact that customer satisfaction is our main goal. But it seems like Amy has focused on other aspects, like cost-cutting and efficiency, which are not our primary objectives at this stage.\\n\\nAlso, there was a lack of research and data to back up the strategies suggested, which I believe is a crucial part of any proposal. \\n\\nI don't mean to criticize, but I think it's essential for us to have these things in mind for future proposals. \\n\\nBest,\\nJohn\\n\\nEmail 2:\\nFrom: Amy Johnson\\nTo: Team\\nSubject: RE: Project Proposal Feedback\\n\\nHello All,\\n\\nThank you for your feedback, John.
