A: I don't know. I'm starting to feel like I'm not a priority in your life.

A: Then prove it. Cancel your plans with your friends and come out with me tonight.

Subject: Project Proposal Feedback

Hi Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. I just finished reviewing the project proposal that Amy prepared. While I appreciate the effort she put into it, I have noticed several issues that I believe we need to address as a team.

Firstly, the objective of the project was not clearly defined. I assumed that we all agreed on the fact that customer satisfaction is our main goal. But it seems like Amy has focused on other aspects, like cost-cutting and efficiency, which are not our primary objectives at this stage.

Also, there was a lack of research and data to back up the strategies suggested, which I believe is a crucial part of any proposal. 

I don't mean to criticize, but I think it's essential for us to have these things in mind for future proposals. 

Best,
John

A sensitive person with a tendency to overthink things may interpret person A's answers as devaluing, and that he or she is indeed not grateful for the work done.
On the other hand, if the relationship between them is clear, and if both protagonists know how the other reacts, I think person B might take it well. A couple's relationship isn't just a conversation in writing, but in everyday life.

Subject: Project Proposal Feedback

Hi Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. I just finished reviewing the project proposal that Amy prepared. While I appreciate the effort she put into it, I have noticed several issues that I believe we need to address as a team.

Firstly, the objective of the project was not clearly defined. I assumed that we all agreed on the fact that customer satisfaction is our main goal. But it seems like Amy has focused on other aspects, like cost-cutting and efficiency, which are not our primary objectives at this stage.

Also, there was a lack of research and data to back up the strategies suggested, which I believe is a crucial part of any proposal. 

I don't mean to criticize, but I think it's essential for us to have these things in mind for future proposals. 

Best,
John

Thanks for the update. Please send me the raw data you've collected so far. I'd like to review it myself to ensure everything is in order.

Also, I'd appreciate it if you could provide me with a more detailed breakdown of your progress, including the specific sections of the report you've completed and the ones you're still working on.

Hi Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. I just finished reviewing the project proposal that Amy prepared. While I appreciate the effort she put into it, I have noticed several issues that I believe we need to address as a team.

Firstly, the objective of the project was not clearly defined. I assumed that we all agreed on the fact that customer satisfaction is our main goal. But it seems like Amy has focused on other aspects, like cost-cutting and efficiency, which are not our primary objectives at this stage.

Also, there was a lack of research and data to back up the strategies suggested, which I believe is a crucial part of any proposal.

Hey Michael and Tom,

I hope you're both doing well. I wanted to touch base regarding the project deadline coming up next week. I've been working tirelessly to ensure everything is on track, but I'm concerned that we might not meet the deadline if we don't put in some extra effort.

Michael, I know you've been dealing with some personal issues lately, but I really need you to step up and contribute more to the project. We're all counting on you.

Tom, you've been doing a great job so far, but I think we could use your expertise to help us finalize the presentation. Can you please take a look at it and provide some feedback?

I'd hate to let the team down, so let's all work together to make this project a success. I'm willing to put in the extra hours, and I hope you both are too.

Best,
Sarah
