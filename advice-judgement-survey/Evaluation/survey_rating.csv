A sensitive person with a tendency to overthink things may interpret person A's answers as devaluing, and that he or she is indeed not grateful for the work done.
On the other hand, if the relationship between them is clear, and if both protagonists know how the other reacts, I think person B might take it well. A couple's relationship isn't just a conversation in writing, but in everyday life.

This was my personal feeling, so I think it's good the advice still has other potential issues listed as I think different people may come out of it feeling different. Why I think this advice is helpful is because then, if you were person B, you can go back to person A and explain what your issue was and how it made you feel. This is sometimes really difficult when you don't have the right words. I often stumble over my words and struggle to verbalize what I think to my significant other and as a result sometimes I give up trying to explain how I feel, because it seems like too much of a task. This is why this advice was helpful - it was not necessarily the last sentence, which says 'have an open conversation' as I think most people know this is what you should do.

I do not think that point 6 (Offer help) was appropriate, though. We do not know how much Sarah already contributed or if it is even a part of her job to help with this project, so I think this is a bad advice as some people can take advantage of you at work if you are too nice and offer too much help. Perhaps the advice should have acknowledged the importance of boundaries. Also, I think the advice should akcnolwedge no email will ever be perfect because we are all humans and other people should understand that.
