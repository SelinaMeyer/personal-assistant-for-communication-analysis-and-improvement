It's better to ask about their availability first before making plans.\n\n3.

Give more notice: Try to give your friends at least a week's notice when asking for help with a big task like moving.\n\n2. Be flexible: Be open to working around your friends' schedules and availability. If Saturday doesn't work, be willing to consider other options.\n\n3. Ask, don't assume: Instead of assuming your friends are available or that past favors guarantee their help, ask politely and be understanding if they can't assist you.\n\n4.
