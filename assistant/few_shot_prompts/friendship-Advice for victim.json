For example, \"I'm surprised they didn't promote you sooner\" could be interpreted as implying that the promotion was overdue or that you didn't deserve it earlier. Similarly, \"You always had a knack for getting noticed when it counts\" might be seen as a bit condescending or insincere. This tone could be making you feel uneasy or unsure about Person D's genuine enthusiasm for your achievement.\n2. **Lack of personal connection**: While your friends are congratulating you and suggesting a celebration, the conversation feels somewhat superficial. There's no real personal connection or inquiry about how you're feeling or what this promotion means to you. This might make you feel like they're not truly invested in your success or happiness.\n3. **Overemphasis on impressing others**: The conversation focuses on impressing your bosses and getting noticed, which might make you feel like your worth is tied to external validation rather than your own accomplishments.
