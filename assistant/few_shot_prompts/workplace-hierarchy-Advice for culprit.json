To alleviate this pressure, you could acknowledge the hard work of your team and offer support where needed. For example, you could say, \"I know we're all working hard to meet the deadline, and I appreciate your dedication to this project. If there's anything I can do to support you, please let me know.\"\n\nOverall, it's important to communicate clearly, be specific with your requests, and show empathy and understanding towards your team."}]
