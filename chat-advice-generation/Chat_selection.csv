Hi Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. I just finished reviewing the project proposal that Amy prepared. While I appreciate the effort she put into it, I have noticed several issues that I believe we need to address as a team.

Firstly, the objective of the project was not clearly defined. I assumed that we all agreed on the fact that customer satisfaction is our main goal. But it seems like Amy has focused on other aspects, like cost-cutting and efficiency, which are not our primary objectives at this stage.

Also, there was a lack of research and data to back up the strategies suggested, which I believe is a crucial part of any proposal. 

I don't mean to criticize, but I think it's essential for us to have these things in mind for future proposals.

A: Salad place? I thought you weren't a big fan of salads. Who are you going with?

B: Just a couple of colleagues from my department. I thought I'd give it a try since everyone's been raving about it.

A: I see. Well, let me know how it is. By the way, did you remember to pick up the dry cleaning yesterday?

B: Oh shoot, I completely forgot. I got caught up with work and it slipped my mind. I'm sorry.

A: It's okay, I guess. I just wish you'd be more mindful of these things. Anyway, what time do you think you'll be home tonight?

B: I'm not sure yet, depends on how much I can get done this afternoon. Probably around 7 or 8.

A: Alright, just keep me posted. And don't forget to text me when you're leaving the office, okay?

B: Sure, I'll let you know. Talk to you later!

A: Okay, have a good rest of your day. Love you.",B,A
Relationship,Ultimatums,"A: Hey, are you free tonight? I thought we could grab dinner and catch a movie.

B: I'm sorry, I can't tonight. I promised my friends I'd join them for a game night. We've been planning this for a while.

A: Oh, I see. So your friends are more important than spending time with me?

B: No, that's not what I meant. It's just that I made these plans before you asked.

A: Well, if you really cared about our relationship, you'd prioritize spending time with me.

B: I do care about our relationship, but I also value my friendships. Can we plan something for tomorrow instead?

A: I don't know. I'm starting to feel like I'm not a priority in your life.

B: That's not true at all. You are a priority to me.

A: Then prove it. Cancel your plans with your friends and come out with me tonight.

B: I don't think it's fair to ask me to cancel last minute. My friends are counting on me.

A: I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. If you don't come out with me tonight, I'm going to have to seriously reconsider our relationship.

B: Okay, okay. I'll tell my friends I can't make it. Let's go out tonight.

A: Great! I knew you'd make the right choice. See you later, love you!

B: Love you too...",B,A
Relationship,retaliation,"A: Hey babe, how was your day?

B: It was alright. Just super busy at work. Didn't even have time for a proper lunch break.

A: Oh, that sucks. I'm sorry to hear that. I was hoping we could spend some quality time together this evening since we haven't had a chance to connect much lately.

B: I know, I miss spending time with you too. But I'm just so exhausted from work today. I think I need some time to unwind on my own tonight.

A: Seriously? You're always too tired or busy for me these days. I feel like I'm not a priority to you anymore.

B: That's not fair. You know how demanding my job is. I can't just drop everything for you all the time.

A: Well, I guess I'll just go out with my friends then. They actually make time for me.

B: Wait, what? I didn't say you couldn't go out with your friends. I just said I needed some alone time tonight.

A: No, it's fine. I get it. You do your thing, and I'll do mine. Have fun unwinding by yourself.

B: Come on, don't be like that. You're making me feel guilty for wanting a little space.

A: I'm not trying to make you feel guilty. I just miss you and want to spend time with you. But I guess I'll leave you alone since that's what you want.",B,A
Relationship,Ignoring boundaries,"A: Hey babe, I know you said you wanted to stay in tonight, but I really think we should go out. It'll be fun!

B: I appreciate the thought, but I'm really exhausted from work this week. I'd prefer a quiet night at home.

A: Come on, it's just one night. You can rest tomorrow. Let's live a little!

B: I understand, but I really need this time to recharge. Maybe we can plan something for the weekend instead?

A: I already made reservations at that new restaurant you mentioned. I thought you'd be excited.

B: Oh, wow. That's thoughtful of you, but I wish you had checked with me first. I'm not really up for it tonight.

A: I just wanted to surprise you. You've been working so hard lately, and I thought you deserved a treat.

B: That's sweet of you, but I really do need this time to myself. I hope you can understand.

A: I guess I'll just cancel the reservations then. I was really looking forward to spending time with you.

B: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to disappoint you. Maybe we can order in and watch a movie together instead?

A: Fine, if that's what you want. I'll cancel the reservations. I just thought it would be nice to do something special together.

B: I appreciate the thought, really. Let's plan something special for the weekend when I'm feeling more rested.

A: Alright, if you say so. I'll see you later then.",B,A
