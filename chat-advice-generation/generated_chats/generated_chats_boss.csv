I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I've just received word from upper management that our project deadline has been moved up by two weeks. I know this puts a lot of pressure on everyone, but we need to do whatever it takes to meet this new timeline.

If we don't deliver on time, there's a real possibility that our department could face significant budget cuts, which could lead to layoffs. I don't want to see that happen, so let's all pull together and make sure we get this done.
