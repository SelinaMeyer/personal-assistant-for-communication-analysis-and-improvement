Speaker 1 (John): 
Hi Team, 
I hope everyone is doing well. I just wanted to remind everyone that the deadline for our project is fast approaching. We need to submit our parts by next Monday. Thanks.

Speaker 2 (Sarah): 
Thanks, John. I've already done my part. I'll upload it to the drive by the end of the day. 

Speaker 3 (Mike): 
Hi John,
I remember you telling us that the deadline was for the following Wednesday. Has it been moved forward?

Speaker 1 (John): 
Hi Mike,
I don't recall ever mentioning a Wednesday deadline. I've consistently said it's next Monday. You must be confusing it with another project.

Speaker 2 (Sarah): 
That's strange, I also remember you mentioning Wednesday as the deadline. 

Speaker 1 (John): 
Hi Sarah,
It seems both of you are misremembering. I have always been clear about the deadline. It's next Monday. It's crucial we don't mix up such important details. 

Speaker 3 (Mike): 
I could have sworn it was Wednesday... but if you say so, John. I'll make sure to finish my part over the weekend.

Speaker 4 (Paul): 
Thanks for the clarification, John. I also thought it was Wednesday, but I trust your memory on this. I'll adjust my schedule accordingly. 

Speaker 1 (John): 
Appreciate the understanding, team. Let's keep our focus and deliver a great project. 

Speaker 2 (Sarah): 
Alright, John. If you're sure then we'll go with Monday. Thanks for clearing that up.

Speaker 1 (John): 
No problem, team. Let's keep the communication clear and I'm sure we'll nail this project. Thanks.
","John: Hey everyone, I wanted to touch base about the project deadline. As per our last meeting, we agreed to have everything wrapped up by Friday. Let's make sure we're all on track!

Sarah: Hi John, I thought we decided on next Wednesday as the deadline during the meeting. I even have it written down in my notes. Did I misunderstand something?

John: Sarah, I'm pretty sure we all agreed on Friday. I distinctly remember discussing it and everyone nodding in agreement. Is your memory playing tricks on you?

Mike: I'm with Sarah on this one. I also have next Wednesday written down as the deadline we agreed upon.

John: Guys, I don't know what to tell you. I clearly remember Friday being the consensus. I even mentioned it to our supervisor after the meeting, and she seemed on board with it. Maybe you both misheard me?

Sarah: I could've sworn it was Wednesday, but if you say you mentioned it to our supervisor, then I guess I must be mistaken. Sorry about that!

Mike: Yeah, my bad. If everyone else is on the same page with Friday, then let's go with that. Thanks for clearing it up, John!

John: No worries, it happens to the best of us. Let's just focus on getting everything done by Friday, and we'll be good to go. Thanks for your hard work, everyone!"

Subject: Project Proposal Feedback

Hi Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. I just finished reviewing the project proposal that Amy prepared. While I appreciate the effort she put into it, I have noticed several issues that I believe we need to address as a team.

Firstly, the objective of the project was not clearly defined. I assumed that we all agreed on the fact that customer satisfaction is our main goal. But it seems like Amy has focused on other aspects, like cost-cutting and efficiency, which are not our primary objectives at this stage.

Also, there was a lack of research and data to back up the strategies suggested, which I believe is a crucial part of any proposal. 

I don't mean to criticize, but I think it's essential for us to have these things in mind for future proposals.

I just wanted to say I thought your feedback was really insightful. You always have a knack for understanding the bigger picture.
