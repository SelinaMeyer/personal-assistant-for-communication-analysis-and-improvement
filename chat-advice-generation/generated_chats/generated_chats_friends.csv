0,peer pressure,"Alex: Hey guys! I've got a fantastic idea for this weekend.

Ben: What's up, Alex?

Alex: We should go on a road trip! We haven't had one in so long.

Liam: Sounds fun, but I've got an important project to finish this weekend.

Alex: Oh come on, Liam. It's just one weekend. You can work on your project next week.

Ben: Yeah, Liam. Live a little! We all need a break sometimes.

Alex: Exactly! And besides, we're all going. You wouldn't want to be the only one not going, right?

Liam: Well, I guess I could try to finish my work early...

Alex: That's the spirit, Liam!","John: Hey guys, are you up for a night out this Friday? I found this new club downtown that's supposed to be amazing!

Sarah: I don't know, John. I have a lot of work to catch up on this weekend.

Michael: Yeah, I'm not sure either. I was planning on having a quiet night in.

John: Come on, guys! We haven't hung out together in ages. It'll be so much fun!

Sarah: I really should focus on my work...

John: Sarah, you're always working. You deserve a break! And Michael, you can have a quiet night in any time. This club is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!

Michael: I guess you're right. It has been a while since we all went out together.

John: Exactly! It won't be the same without you both there. Let's make some unforgettable memories together!

Sarah: Alright, I suppose I can put off my work for one night. Count me in!

Michael: Fine, I'm in too. But let's not make it a late night, okay?

John: Awesome! This is going to be epic. I'll send you both the details later. Get ready for the best night of your lives!"
1,flattery,"John: Hey guys! How's it going?

Amy: Hi John! Doing good. You?

John: Fantastic! By the way, I've been meaning to say, Amy, I've always admired your generosity.

Amy: Oh, thanks John. That's kind of you.

John: Of course, it's true. You're always willing to go that extra mile for others.

Amy: I try my best. 

John: I know you do! That's why I thought you might be able to help me. I'm short on rent this month, can you lend me some?

Amy: Oh, sure John. How much do you need?

John: You're a lifesaver, Amy. Just a couple hundred should do, I promise I'll pay you back next month.

Amy: Don't worry about it, John. I'll transfer it to you.","John: Hey guys, I need some advice. I'm thinking about asking my boss for a raise. What do you think?

Emily: That's a great idea, John! You definitely deserve it with all the hard work you've been putting in.

Sarah: I don't know, John. The company has been going through some financial difficulties lately. It might not be the best time.

Emily: Don't listen to Sarah, John. You're one of the most valuable employees in your department. Your boss would be crazy not to give you a raise.

John: Thanks, Emily. I really appreciate your support. I'm just worried about how my boss will react.

Emily: Trust me, John. You're so charismatic and likable. I'm sure you'll be able to convince your boss easily. You have a way with words that people just can't resist.

Sarah: I still think you should be cautious, John. Maybe wait a few months and see how things go.

Emily: Sarah, you're being too pessimistic. John, you're a natural leader and your boss knows it. You've got this!

John: You know what, you're right, Emily. I'm going to talk to my boss tomorrow. Thanks for the encouragement!

Emily: Anytime, John! Let us know how it goes. I have no doubt you'll succeed."
2,favor sharking,"Anna: Hey guys! How was your day?

Mark: Hey Anna! It was great, thanks for asking.

Lily: Mine was okay, just a bit tiring.

Anna: Oh poor Lily, you always seem to have a hard day.

Lily: Yeah, it's just that I have a lot on my plate currently.

Mark: If you need help with anything, Lily, let us know.

Anna: Definitely! Remember when I helped you with your presentation last week, Lily?

Lily: Yes, Anna. I'm really grateful for that.

Anna: Well, you know, I'm always here to help. By the way, I've been thinking about throwing a party this weekend. 

Mark: Sounds fun, count me in!

Anna: Great! Lily, since you owe me one, could you handle the food and drinks?

Lily: Umm... I guess I can do that.

Anna: Awesome! Thanks, Lily. You're a lifesaver.","John: Hey guys, I need some help moving this weekend. Anyone available to lend a hand?

Sarah: I wish I could, but I have a family event on Saturday. Sorry, John!

Mike: I might be able to help for a couple of hours on Sunday afternoon. What time were you thinking?

John: I was hoping to get it all done on Saturday, but Sunday afternoon could work too. I'll need help with some heavy lifting and packing. Pizza and beers on me!

Mike: Alright, I can probably make Sunday work. Just let me know the details later this week.

John: Thanks, Mike! I really appreciate it. By the way, didn't you say I could borrow your truck for the move? That would be a huge help!

Mike: Oh, um, I don't remember saying that. I might need the truck this weekend.

John: Really? I could've sworn you mentioned it when I helped you paint your living room last month. No worries if you can't, but I was counting on it.

Mike: Ah, I guess I did say that. Sure, you can borrow the truck. Just fill up the tank when you're done.

John: You're a lifesaver, Mike! Thanks a bunch. See you Sunday!"
3,backhanded compliments,"Person A: Hey guys, just wanted to share my good news. I got promoted at work!

Person B: Oh wow, congrats! You must be over the moon.

Person C: That's awesome, A! You've been working hard.

Person D: Congrats, A. I'm surprised they didn't promote you sooner considering how long you've been there.

Person A: Thanks, guys. I'm really excited.

Person B: You should be! It's a big step up.

Person C: Definitely. We should celebrate.

Person D: Yes, definitely. After all, it's not everyday you manage to impress your bosses. 

Person A: Thanks, D. That means a lot. 

Person B: How about drinks on Saturday?

Person C: Sounds great. Congrats again, A.

Person D: Yes, congrats. You always had a knack for getting noticed when it counts.","John: Hey guys, I'm thinking about going on a trip to Europe this summer. What do you think?

Sarah: That sounds amazing, John! I've always wanted to go to Europe. Where are you planning to visit?

John: I'm thinking about doing a tour of Italy, France, and Spain. It's been on my bucket list for years.

Mike: Wow, that's quite an ambitious trip, John. I'm surprised you're considering it, given how much you like to stick to your comfort zone. But hey, maybe this will be a good opportunity for you to branch out a bit.

Sarah: I think it's a great idea, John. You deserve a nice vacation after working so hard this year.

John: Thanks, Sarah. I'm really excited about it. I've been saving up for a while now.

Mike: Well, I guess if you've managed to save up enough money, then go for it. I just hope you don't get overwhelmed by all the planning and logistics involved. It can be a lot to handle for someone who's not used to traveling much.

Sarah: Don't listen to him, John. You're more than capable of planning this trip. And if you need any help, I'm happy to assist you.

John: I appreciate the offer, Sarah. I might take you up on that. I'm sure I can handle it though, Mike. I'm not totally inept when it comes to travel planning.

Mike: Of course, of course. I didn't mean to imply that you were. I'm sure you'll do just fine. Anyway, let me know if you need any recommendations for places to stay or things to do. I've been to Europe a few times myself, so I might be able to offer some helpful advice."
4,exclusion,"Mitchell: Hey guys! I was thinking we should all catch up this weekend. How about a movie night at my place?

Sophie: Sounds like a great idea, Mitchell! I'm in.

Alex: I'm in too! 

Mitchell: Awesome! I was thinking we could watch the new Marvel movie.

Sophie: Ooh, I've been wanting to see that.

Ryan: I'm not really into superhero movies, guys.

Mitchell: Hmm, well Ryan, maybe you can join us next time. I think the majority of us want to see this one.

Sophie: Yeah, Ryan, come on! We can do something you'd like next time.

Alex: Yeah, don't worry Ryan. You'll pick the next one.

Ryan: Okay, I guess. 

Mitchell: Great! So, it's settled then. Saturday, 7 PM at my place. Can't wait!","John: Hey guys, I had a great idea for this weekend! How about we go on a hiking trip?

Sarah: That sounds amazing! I'm totally in. 🙂

Mike: Count me in too! It's been a while since we've done something outdoorsy together.

John: Awesome! I was thinking we could invite Emily as well. She mentioned she wanted to join us on our next adventure.

Sarah: Emily? I don't know, John. I feel like she doesn't really fit in with our group dynamic.

Mike: Yeah, I'm not sure if inviting her is the best idea.

John: I guess you're right. It might be better to keep it to just the three of us this time. We can always plan something with her separately.

Sarah: Exactly! Plus, we haven't had quality time with just the three of us in a long time. It'll be great to catch up without any distractions.

Mike: I agree. Let's keep this trip exclusive to our little trio. 😄

John: Alright, it's settled then! I'll start looking into some hiking trails nearby. This is going to be an awesome weekend! 🌄

Sarah: Can't wait! 🙌

Mike: Same here! Let's make it a memorable one. 😎"
5,gaslighting,"Anna: Hey guys, I was thinking about having a movie night at my place this Saturday. What do you think?

John: Sounds good to me! What movie are we watching?

Anna: I was thinking about ""A Quiet Place II"". I remember we all liked the first part. 

Lisa: Oh, I actually don't remember watching the first part. Are you sure?

Anna: Lisa, you were definitely there! Don't you remember we were all at my place and we had pizza?

John: Yeah Lisa, I remember you were there too. It was a great night!

Lisa: Really? I honestly can't remember. Maybe I was tired or something?

Anna: Oh Lisa, you're being so forgetful lately, it's almost concerning. You were definitely there and you loved the movie.

John: Yeah, you even suggested we should watch the sequel when it comes out.

Lisa: I guess I'll have to believe you guys then. Okay, count me in for Saturday.","John: Hey guys, I'm throwing a party this weekend. You're all invited!

Sarah: That sounds great, John! What time should we come over?

John: Around 8 pm would be perfect. It's going to be a blast!

Mike: Count me in! I'll bring some snacks and drinks.

John: Awesome! Sarah, you mentioned you might have a family thing this weekend. Are you sure you can make it?

John: Really? I distinctly remember you telling me last week that you might have to visit your grandparents or something.

Sarah: No, I don't think so. I would remember if I had plans like that.

John: Come on, Sarah. You definitely said something about it. Maybe you just forgot.

Mike: Hey, let's not worry about it. The important thing is that Sarah can make it to the party now.

Sarah: Yeah, I guess you're right, Mike. I must have gotten confused or something.

John: No worries, Sarah. I'm just glad you can come. It wouldn't be the same without you!

Sarah: Thanks, guys. I'm looking forward to it!"
6,guit-tripping,"Anna: Hey guys, I was thinking about having a movie night at my place this Saturday. What do you think?

John: Sounds good to me! What movie are we watching?

Lily: Yeah, I'm in! 

David: I'm sorry, Anna, I already made plans for this Saturday.

Anna: Oh, no worries, David. I just thought it's been a while since we all hung out together. I guess some things are more important.

John: Oh, David, can't you reschedule your plans?

Lily: Yes, David, it would be nice if we all could be there.

David: I'll see what I can do, guys.","John: Hey guys, I'm really struggling with my math homework. I've been trying to solve these problems for hours and I just can't seem to get it. 😞

Emily: Oh no, that sucks! I wish I could help, but I'm swamped with my own assignments right now. 📚

Mike: Same here, man. I've got a huge project due tomorrow and I'm nowhere near finished. 😓

John: I understand, no worries. I just thought that since you guys are my best friends, you'd be willing to help me out. I mean, I've always been there for you when you needed me. Remember when I stayed up all night helping you with your science project, Emily? And Mike, I've never hesitated to lend you money whenever you needed it. But I guess I was wrong to expect the same in return. 😔

Emily: John, it's not like that! We care about you, it's just that we're really busy right now. 😞

Mike: Yeah, man. You know we've got your back. It's just a tough week for all of us.

John: I get it, no problem. I'll just fail this assignment and probably tank my grade in the class. I mean, what are friends for, right? 🙃

Emily: Okay, okay. I can probably spare an hour or two to help you out. Send me the problems and I'll take a look.

Mike: Yeah, same here. Just give me a bit to finish up what I'm working on and I'll hop on a call with you guys.

John: Thanks, you guys are the best! I knew I could count on you. 🙏"
