0,gaslighting,"A: Hey, I saw your ex at the mall today. 

B: Really? How did that go?

A: Well, she seemed a little too happy to see me. 

B: What do you mean?

A: She was flirting a lot. I think she's trying to get back with me.

B: That makes me uncomfortable. I thought you said you both weren't in contact anymore?

A: I don't remember ever saying that.

B: Yes, you did. You said you both decided to cut contact right after the breakup.

A: Babe, you're imagining things. I never said that. 

B: I'm not imagining things. We've had a conversation about this before.

A: No, we didn't. I think you're getting confused.

B: I'm not. I remember it clearly.

A: You're overthinking, babe. You need to relax.","A: Hey, where were you last night? I tried calling you but you didn't pick up.

B: I was out with friends. I told you about it yesterday, remember?

A: No, you didn't. I would have remembered if you did.

B: I'm pretty sure I mentioned it to you. Maybe you forgot?

A: Are you saying I'm forgetful now? I clearly remember you never said anything about going out.

B: I didn't say you're forgetful, I just thought I told you. Sorry if I didn't.

A: You're always doing this, making me feel like I'm losing my mind. I know you didn't tell me.

B: I apologize if I made you feel that way, it wasn't my intention. Let's just move on, okay?

A: Fine, but I don't appreciate you making me question my own memory.

B: I understand. I'll make sure to communicate better next time.

A: You better. I don't like feeling like I'm going crazy in this relationship.

B: I'm sorry, I never meant to make you feel that way. I love you.

A: I love you too, but please don't do this again.","A: Hey, I'm feeling a bit hurt. I thought we were going to spend time together tonight, but you bailed on me.

B: I'm sorry, I just had a lot of work to do. You know how important my job is to me.

A: Yeah, I know, but you promised we'd have a date night. I feel like you don't value our relationship as much as your job.

B: Wow, that's really not fair. I work hard to provide for us and you're making me feel guilty for it. I can't believe you're acting like this.

A: I'm not trying to make you feel guilty, I just want to feel like a priority sometimes.

B: You are a priority, but I also have to focus on my career. I don't understand why you're making such a big deal out of this.

A: I'm not making a big deal out of it, I just want to feel loved and appreciated.

B: I do love and appreciate you, but it sounds like you're trying to start an argument. I don't have time for this right now.

A: I'm not trying to start an argument, I just want to talk about how I'm feeling.

B: Fine, we can talk about it later. But I have to go now, I have a lot of work to do.

A: Okay, I guess we'll talk later then.

B: Alright. Talk to you later."
